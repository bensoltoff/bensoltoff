### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Lecuter in Information Science at [Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/). I teach learners data science, research design, data communication, and web design.

I enjoy working with individuals from all backgrounds interested in applying computational methods to extract knowledge and inferences from a wide-range of domains. I have training and experience in data science and policy evaluation. In addition to my academic work, I offer consulting services for organizations interested in data science, including research and analysis as well as tailored workshops teaching programming skills to your employees.
